# Stack Pattern

## Core Concept
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It is used to store and manage data in a particular order.

## When to Use
- Problems involving balanced parentheses
- Evaluating expressions (postfix, prefix)
- Undo mechanisms in text editors
- Depth-first search (DFS) in graphs
- Backtracking problems



## Common Techniques
- Using an array or linked list to implement the stack
- Pushing and popping elements based on conditions
- Using a stack to reverse data or track previous states

## Edge Cases to Watch
- Empty stack operations
- Stack overflow (too many elements)
- Handling different data types
- Ensuring correct order of operations

## Common Problems & Variations
- Valid Parentheses
- Min Stack
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- Daily Temperatures
- Next Greater Element

## Time/Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(1) for push and pop operations
- Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack
- Complexity driven by the number of operations and elements stored
